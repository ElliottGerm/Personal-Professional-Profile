    <h2>Personal History</h2>
    <p>My name is Elliott Theodore Germanovich. I was born in Virginia Beach VA. After graduating from Tallwood High
      School in Virginia Beach I got a job working at Best Buy and started attending community College at Tidewater
      Community
      College. In 2015 I moved to Washington D.C. to live with my mom and finish my associates in Computer Science at
      the Northern Virginia Community College in Alexandria VA. After finishing community college I moved to
      Harrisonburg VA in order to attend James Madison University so that I could obtain my bachelors in Computer
      Science. I am currently a senior at JMU with one semster left. </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>My top priority goal to date is to graduate college with a bachelors degree and obtain a
      full time positon in the field of computer science. <br> <br>
      A longer term goal of mine is to rent a camper and make a cross country trip across the U.S. over the course of
      several months. During this trip I plan to stop at major landmarks, national parks, various MLB stadiums, concert
      venues, museums and any other attraction that catches my attention.
